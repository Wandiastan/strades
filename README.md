## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MetaAPI.cloud account and API token
- MT4/MT5 trading account credentials

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the backend folder**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure MetaAPI Token:**
   - The server is pre-configured with a MetaAPI token
   - For production, consider using environment variables

## Usage

### Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000 (or the port specified in the PORT environment variable).

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server with nodemon for automatic restarts during development.

## API Endpoints

## Deployment to Render

### 1. Prepare for Deployment

The server is already configured for Render deployment with:
- Dynamic port binding (`process.env.PORT`)
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 2. Deploy to Render

1. **Create a new Web Service on Render**
2. **Connect your repository** (or upload the backend folder)
3. **Configure the service:**
   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start`
   - **Environment:** Node

### 3. Environment Variables (Optional)

For production, consider setting these environment variables:
- `PORT` - Server port (Render will set this automatically)
- `META_API_TOKEN` - Your MetaAPI token (currently hardcoded)

## MetaAPI Configuration

The server uses MetaAPI.cloud for MT4/MT5 connections. The current configuration includes:

- **API Token:** Pre-configured with a valid token
- **Connection Type:** Cloud-based connections
- **Features:** Account management, position tracking, order management, trade history

### Required Account Information

When connecting to an MT4/MT5 account, you need:
- **Login/Account ID:** Your trading account number
- **Password:** Investor/read-only password (not the main trading password)
- **Server:** Your broker's MT4/MT5 server address

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling:
- Input validation for required fields
- MetaAPI connection error handling
- Graceful error responses with meaningful messages
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Security Considerations

- The server uses CORS for cross-origin requests
- Passwords are not stored permanently (only during active connections)
- Consider implementing authentication for production use
- Use HTTPS in production environments

## Testing

Run the included test script to verify API functionality:

```bash
node test-api.js
```

This will test the health endpoint and attempt a connection (with dummy data).
